Set sail for the social emotional seas! This album is a groovy navigational tool
for bigs and littles alike - a musical map for big feelings. Get ready to sing,
dance, play, and dream! As a neurodivergent adult, my goal is to bring different
ways of seeing the world to light. Thereâ€™s no better place to start learning
about how to explore feelings than through song, and Ms. Kiersten has the songs
for you! Ms. Kiersten's debut album, *Connecting the Dots* is available now to
stream on all your favorite streaming services!
